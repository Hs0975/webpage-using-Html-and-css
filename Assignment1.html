                    <p>Virat Kohli ( born 5 November 1988) is an Indian
                        international
                        cricketer and the former captain of the Indian national cricket team who plays for Royal
                        Challengers
                        Bangalore in the IPL and Delhi in domestic cricket. Considered to be one of the best cricketers
                        in
                        the
                        world, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of the sport.[4]
                        Nicknamed
                        "The King", due to his dominant style of play and popularity, Kohli holds numerous records in
                        his
                        career
                        across all formats. In 2020, the International Cricket Council named him the male cricketer of
                        the
                        decade. Kohli has also contributed to India's successes, captaining the team from 2014 to 2022,
                        and
                        winning the 2011 World Cup and the 2013 Champions trophy. He is among the only four Indian
                        cricketers
                        who have played over 500 matches for India.[5]</p>
                    <p>Born and raised in New Delhi, Kohli trained at the West Delhi Cricket Academy and started his
                        youth
                        career with the Delhi Under-15 team. He made his international debut in 2008 and quickly became
                        a
                        key
                        player in the ODI team and later made his Test debut in 2011. In 2013, Kohli reached the number
                        one
                        spot
                        in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen for the first time. During 2014 T20 World Cup, he set a
                        record
                        for
                        the most runs scored in the tournament. In 2018, he achieved yet another milestone, becoming the
                        world's
                        top-ranked Test batsman, making him the only Indian cricketer to hold the number one spot in all
                        three
                        formats of the game. His form continued in 2019, when he became the first player to score 20,000
                        international runs in a single decade. In 2021, Kohli made the decision to step down as the
                        captain
                        of
                        the Indian national team for T20Is, following the T20 World Cup and in early 2022 he stepped
                        down as
                        the
                        captain of the Test team as well.</p>

                    <h2 id="early">Early life</h2>
                    <p>
                        Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu family. His father, Prem
                        Kohli,
                        worked as a criminal lawyer and his mother, Saroj Kohli, served as a housewife. He has an older
                        brother,
                        Vikas, and an older sister, Bhawna.[6] Kohli's formative years were spent in the Uttam Nagar and
                        commenced his early education at Vishal Bharti Public School.[7] According to his family, Kohli
                        exhibited an early affinity for cricket as a mere three-year-old. He would pick up a cricket
                        bat,
                        display natural skill, and request his father to bowl to him.[8]
                    </p>
                    <p>In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy (WCDA) was created and on 30 May of that year, Prem
                        Kohli,
                        espoused his younger son's fervour for cricket, assisted nine-year-old Kohli's aspirations and
                        arranged
                        for him to meet Rajkumar Sharma, who initially perceived him to be just another enthusiastic and
                        determined young boy. However, two weeks later, Sharma was impressed by Kohli's accuracy and
                        power
                        in
                        throwing.[9] Upon the suggestion of their neighbours, Kohli's father considered enrolling his
                        son in
                        a
                        professional cricket academy, as they believed that his cricketing abilities merited more than
                        just
                        playing in the gully cricket.[10] Despite his abilities, he faced the setback of being unable to
                        secure
                        a place in the under-14 Delhi team, not due to a lack of merit but due to extraneous factors.
                        Prem
                        Kohli
                        received offers to relocate his son to influential clubs, which would have ensured his
                        selection,
                        but he
                        declined the proposals, as he was determined that Kohli should earn his recognition based on his
                        own
                        merit and overcome the system of nepotism and deceit prevalent in the Delhi and District Cricket
                        Association (DDCA). Kohli persisted and eventually found his way into the under-15 Delhi
                        team.[11]
                        He
                        received training at the academy while simultaneously participating in matches at the Sumeet
                        Dogra
                        Academy located at Vasundhara Enclave.[12] As per Sharma's recollection of Kohli's initial days
                        at
                        his
                        academy, he exuded remarkable talent, making it arduous for the coach to curb his enthusiasm.

                        remained prepared to bat at any position, and often, Sharma had to physically coerce him to
                        leave
                        the
                        training sessions, as he was reluctant to depart.[13] In pursuit of furthering his cricketing
                        career, he
                        transitioned to Saviour Convent School during his ninth-grade education.[10] Kohli's ardent
                        passion
                        for
                        cricket compelled him to travel long distances with his father to ensure that he never missed a
                        match.
                        With time, he diligently honed his skills and diversified his range of shots, commanding respect
                        from
                        the local bowlers.[14]</p>

                    <h2 id="youth">Youth and domestic career</h2>
                    <p>Kohli's junior cricket career kicked off in October 2002 at the Luhnu cricket ground in a Polly
                        Umrigar
                        match against the host state of Himachal Pradesh. In his debut match, Kohli managed to score a
                        total
                        of
                        fifteen runs. His first half-century in national cricket came at Ferozeshah Kotla, where he
                        scored
                        70
                        runs against Harayana.[18] By the end of the season, Kohli had amassed a total of 172 runs,
                        emerging
                        as
                        the highest run-scorer for his side with an average of 34.40.[19] During the 2003–04 season,
                        Kohli
                        was
                        appointed as the captain of the under-15 team. In his first match of the season, he scored 54
                        runs
                        in
                        Delhi's victory over Himachal Pradesh. In the next fixture against Jammu and Kashmir, Kohli
                        scored
                        his
                        maiden century with a score of 119 in a BCCI-conducted game. By the end of the season, he had
                        amassed a
                        total of 390 runs at an average of 78, which included two centuries.[20][21][a] Towards the end
                        of
                        2004,
                        Kohli earned selection for the 2004–05 Vijay Merchant Trophy with the Delhi under-17 team. In
                        the
                        four
                        matches that he played, Kohli accumulated a total of 470 runs, with his highest score being 251*
                        runs.
                        The team's coach, Ajit Chaudhary, lauded his performance and was particularly impressed with his
                        temperament on the field.[22][23] In the 2005–06 season, Kohli commenced his innings with a
                        score of
                        227
                        against Punjab. Following their victory over Uttar Pradesh in the quarter-finals, Delhi was
                        scheduled to
                        play against Baroda in the semi-finals. The team had high expectations from Kohli, who had
                        promised
                        his
                        coach to finish the job. True to his word, Kohli went on to score 228 runs, leading Delhi to
                        victory.
                        The team later secured the tournament with a five-wicket win over Mumbai, where he contributed
                        with
                        a
                        half-century in the first innings.[24] He ended as the highest run-scorer with a total of 757
                        runs
                        from
                        7 matches, averaging 84.11.[25]</p>
                    <p>On the 18th of February, 2006, Kohli made his debut in List A cricket, playing against Services
                        in
                        the
                        Ranji One-Day Trophy, but he did not have the opportunity to bat during the match.[26] In 2006,
                        Kohli
                        had garnered enough attention to earn a spot in the state senior team. Subsequently, he made his
                        first-class debut on the 23rd of November, 2006, during the opening match of the Ranji Trophy
                        season
                        against Tamil Nadu. However, his debut innings was a brief one, as he was dismissed after
                        scoring
                        ten
                        runs.[27] In a sequence of three matches, Kohli failed to score a fifty, leading his coaches to
                        provide
                        him with counselling. In the subsequent match against former champions, Karnataka, Delhi found
                        themselves trailing with a score of 130/5, with Kohli remaining unbeaten on 40 at the end of
                        thep
                        day's
                        play. That very night, Kohli's father passed away at 3:54 a.m. Despite the heart-wrenching news,
                        Kohli
                        returned to the match and continued to bat and scored 90 runs before he was dismissed.[28] The
                        team's
                        coach, Chetan Chauhan was impressed by Kohli's resolute determination and unwavering attitude in
                        the
                        face of adversity. Venkatesh Prasad also lauded his crucial knock, which was executed in the
                        midst
                        of an
                        emotional upheaval.[29] Following his dismissal, Kohli immediately attended his father's
                        funeral.
                        His
                        innings, however, proved to be crucial for Delhi as they were able to avoid the follow-on. The
                        team's
                        captain, Mithun Manhas, praised Kohli for his performance, acknowledging its pivotal role in the
                        team's
                        success.[29]</p>

                        <h4 class="subhead">2008–2009: Debut and maiden stint</h4>
                        <p>In August 2008, Kohli was selected for inclusion in the ODl squad for the tour of Sri Lanka
                            and
                            the Champions Trophy in Pakistan. Prior to the Sri Lankan tour, Kohli had limited
                            experience,
                            with only eight List A matches under his belt.[45] So, his selection was considered a
                            "surprise
                            call-up".[46] During the Sri Lankan tour, as both first-choice openers Sachin Tendulkar and
                            Virender Sehwag, were unable to play due to injury, Kohli was required to fill the role of
                            makeshift opener throughout the series.[47] On 18 August 2008, Kohli made his international
                            debut at the age of 19 in the first ODI of the tour, where he was dismissed for 12 runs,
                            caught
                            dead in front by an incutter from Nuwan Kulasekara.[48] However, in the fourth match of the
                            series, Kohli achieved his inaugural half century in the ODl format, with a total of
                            fifty-four
                            runs scored.[49]

                            Following the postponement of the Champions Trophy to 2009, Kohli was picked as a
                            replacement
                            for the injured Shikhar Dhawan in the India A squad for the unofficial Tests against
                            Australia A
                            in September 2008.[50] Despite limited opportunities, he managed to make an impact in the
                            single
                            innings that he participated in, scoring 49 runs.[51] In October 2008, Kohli participated in
                            a
                            four-day tour match against Australia as part of the Indian Board President's XI team. The
                            match
                            featured a formidable Australian bowling line-up that consisted of Brett Lee, Stuart Clark,
                            Mitchell Johnson, Peter Siddle and Jason Krejza. Despite this, Kohli displayed his batting
                            prowess by scoring 105 runs in the first innings and an unbeaten 16 runs in the second
                            innings,
                            demonstrating his ability to perform against high-level international competition.[52]

                            In November 2008, Kohli was selected for inclusion in the squad for the home ODI series
                            against
                            England, due to the presence of established and experienced players such as Tendulkar and
                            Sehwag, he was not given an opportunity to play in any of the matches.[53] In December 2008,
                            Kohli was awarded a Grade D contract by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) as
                            part
                            of the annual contract list for the Indian national team which entitled him to receive ₹1.5
                            million (equivalent to ₹4.2 million or US$52,000 in 2023), A certain level of remuneration
                            for
                            representing the national team in various matches and events.[54] Despite being awarded a
                            contract, in January, Kohli was dropped for the five-match ODl series against Sri Lanka in
                            Sri
                            Lanka.[55]

                            In July–August 2009, Kohli was selected in the four-team Emerging Players Tournament, held
                            in
                            Australia. He was selected to open the innings for the Indian Emerging Players team in the
                            tournament, and he went on to have a standout performance. Kohli finished as the
                            tournament's
                            leading run-scorer, with a total of 398 runs from seven matches, at an average of 66.33. He
                            was
                            particularly impressive in the final match, where he scored 104 runs off 102 balls against
                            the
                            South Africa Emerging Players team in Brisbane. His strong performance helped lead his team
                            to a
                            17-run victory and the tournament title.[56][57] At the conclusion of the tournament, Kris
                            Srikkanth, the Chairman of the Indian national selection committee, expressed his admiration
                            for
                            Kohli's performance during the tournament. Srikkanth stated, "I must say, opener Virat Kohli
                            was
                            outstanding. Some of the shots he played spoke about his ability."[58] Kohli himself has
                            stated
                            that this tournament was a "turning point" in his career.[59]

                            In August 2009, Kohli returned to the national team after recovering from a minor shoulder
                            injury, replacing the injured Gautam Gambhir in the Indian squad for the tri-series in Sri
                            Lanka.[60] He was also utilized as a middle order batsman in the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy
                            due
                            to an injury sustained by Yuvraj Singh.[61] In December of that same year, he was included
                            in
                            the team for home ODI series against Sri Lanka and scored 27[62] and 54 in the first two
                            ODIs
                            before making way for Yuvraj, who regained fitness for the third ODI. However, due to the
                            reoccurrence of a finger injury, Yuvraj was ruled out indefinitely,[63] which led to Kohli's
                            return to the team in the fourth ODI at Kolkata. In that match, Kohli scored his maiden ODI
                            century–107 off 114 balls while sharing a 224-run partnership for the third wicket with
                            Gambhir.
                            As a result of this performance, India won by seven wickets and sealed the series
                            3–1.[64][b]

                        <p>In 2007, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) introduced the Indian Premier
                            League
                            (IPL), a franchise-based Twenty20 league. Among the franchises, Royal Challengers Bangalore,
                            owned by Vijay Mallya at the time, selected Kohli to join their team for a sum of $30,000
                            through a draft. This decision was influenced by Kohli's performance in the Under-19 World
                            Cup
                            held in Malaysia.[312]

                            2008–2009: Early seasons
                            In the inaugural match of the IPL, Kohli played in a high-stakes encounter against the
                            Kolkata
                            Knight Riders, where he fell early to an dismissal, contributing a single run to the team's
                            pursuit of a target of 223 runs.[313] As the tournament progressed, Kohli found himself
                            occupying a position in the middle order, but his impact in this role was relatively
                            limited,
                            prompting a strategic decision to reinstate him at the top order during the match against
                            the
                            Deccan Charges. It was in this role that he rediscovered his form and made contributions to
                            his
                            team's cause.[314] However, in the last two games of the tournament, Kohli had to sacrifice
                            his
                            preferred position in order to accommodate Misbah-ul-Haq, taking on the responsibility of
                            batting in the middle order once again.[315] Concluding the season, Kohli's individual
                            performance yielded a total of 165 runs, as Bangalore secured the seventh position on the
                            points
                            table.[316]

                            matches
                            before bouncing back with a half-century in the third match against Deccan Chargers, in
                            team's
                            defeat.[317] Throughout the remainder of the season, Kohli displayed moderate performances
                            or
                            found limited opportunities to bat, owing to the dominance of top-order batsmen Jacques
                            Kallis
                            and Ross Taylor. This proved advantageous for the team, as they secured a spot in the
                            playoffs.[318] In the semi-final against Chennai Super Kings, Kohli made crucial
                            contributions
                            to the team's successful chase, propelling Bangalore to the final.[319] In final against
                            Deccan
                            Charges, Kohli got stumped for 7 as Bangalore fell short by a margin of 8 runs, thus
                            concluding
                            the season as runners-up.[320]

                            2010–2012: Rise, retention and realization
                            In the 2010 season of the IPL, Kohli, assuming the role of vice-captain for the Bangalore,
                            was
                            positioned strategically in the middle order, he augmented Bangalore's batting depth and
                            made
                            notable contributions to the team's success. Notably, his contribution was observed during a
                            victory over the Kings XI Punjab, where he played an instrumental role in concluding the
                            match.[321] Furthermore, his cameos in away fixtures against the Chennai Super Kings[322]
                            and
                            Kings XI Punjab, forging valuable partnerships, particularly with Kevin Pietersen.[323]
                            Kohli's
                            standout performances came in futile encounter against the Deccan Chargers, where he scored
                            58
                            runs at a strike rate of 165.[324] As the season progressed, Kohli's fielding prowess also
                            came
                            to the fore, augmenting his contribution to the team's cause.[325] Upon securing a place in
                            the
                            playoffs, the Bangalore team confronted Mumbai Indians in the semi-final. Bangalore suffered
                            a
                            setback, succumbing to a defeat margin of 35 runs, as Kohli's contribution was limited to a
                            tally of 7 runs in Bangalore's total, thereby ending Bangalore's campaign in the
                            tournament.[326] In the Champions League Twenty20 held in September, the Bangalore team
                            found
                            themselves in an encounter against the Mumbai Indians. In pursuit of a target of 165 runs,
                            Kohli
                            played a steady innings, contributing 47 runs. The match came down to the final ball, which
                            resulted in Kohli's dismissal, leading to Bangalore falling short by a margin of 2
                            runs.[327] As
                            a consequence, their upcoming game against the Lions became a virtual knockout match. In
                            this
                            must-win encounter, Kohli scored 49* runs, guiding his team to victory and securing a place
                            in
                            the semi-finals.[328] In the semi-final clash against the Chennai Super Kings, Bangalore
                            faced a
                            significant defeat of 52 runs(D/L method).

                            Prior to the 2011 season of the IPL, Kohli was the sole player retained by Bangalore, for an
                            amount of US$1.8 million.[329] In the opening match against the Kochi Tuskers Kerala, Kohli
                            started his campaign with a score of 23 runs.[330] He registered his first half-century of
                            the
                            season against the Deccan Chargers, in pursuit of what was then the second-highest run
                            chase,
                            however Bangalore fell short by 33 runs.[331] After lacklustre start for Bangalore, winning
                            two
                            out of their first six matches, Kohli scored 56 runs in the next match against the Delhi
                            Daredevils, and was awarded the player of the match for the first time in the
                            tournament.[332]
                            In the subsequent match, he continued his form against the Pune Warriors, where he claimed
                            his
                            second player of the match award. It was during this match that Kohli became the leading
                            run-scorer of the season, donning the Orange cap for the short time, and he also surpassed
                            the
                            milestone of 1000 runs in the IPL.[333] During the mid-tournament, with regular captain
                            Daniel
                            Vettori sustaining an injury, Kohli had the opportunity to captain his side for the first
                            time
                            in an IPL match.[334] Team's coach, Ray Jennings praised Kohli for his efforts, acknowledged
                            his
                            potential to become the future captain not only of the franchise but also of the Indian
                            national
                            team.[335] The team ended their league stage campaign on a high note, defeating the Chennai
                            Super Kings and securing the top position on the points table.[336] In the first qualifier,
                            Kohli scored 70 of 44 balls. Setting a target of 175 runs, Bangalore failed to defend,
                            resulting
                            in knockout match against the Mumbai Indians.[337] In the knockout match, Bangalore
                            triumphed
                            over Mumbai, securing their place in the IPL final for the second time. In the final,
                            chasing a
                            target of 205 runs, Kohli contributed 35 runs to the team's total. However, Bangalore once
                            again
                            fell short in their pursuit of the title.[338] During the season, Kohli amassed 557 runs,
                            including four half-centuries, and earning the distinction of being the second-highest
                            run-scorer of the season, trailing West-Indian teammate Chris Gayle.[339] In the Champions
                            League, Bangalore encountered a defeat in their first match against the Warriors. In the
                            following match, Kohli got dismissed for a duck, leading to another loss for Bangalore. To
                            secure a spot in the semi-finals, they needed to win their remaining two matches. In their
                            last
                            group-stage match against the Southern Redbacks, Kohli showcased his aggressive batting by
                            scoring 70 runs off just 36 balls, propelling Bangalore into the semi-finals.[340] In the
                            semi-final clash against the New South Wales Blues, Kohli once again played match-winning
                            innings, scoring an unbeaten 84 runs.[341] However, in the final showdown against the Mumbai
                            Indians, Bangalore suffered a defeat by a margin of 31 runs.

                            In the 2012 season of the IPL, Kohli registered single-digit scores in the first two matches
                            before bouncing back in the third match against the Chennai Super Kings, scoring 57
                            runs.[342]
                            He struggled to maintain consistency in subsequent matches, reaching a total of 165 runs by
                            the
                            ninth game with his strike-rate stood at 102.08, accompanied by an average of 18.[343] Kohli
                            did
                            manage to contribute 45 runs in the following match against the Kings XI Punjab to his
                            team's
                            cause.[344] As the season progressed, ineffectiveness of Bangalore's captain, Daniel
                            Vettori, as
                            a player led to a strategic alteration. Vettori made the decision to step down as captain
                            and
                            handed the leadership role to Kohli for the remaining matches of the season.[345] His
                            breakthrough performance in the season came during the match against the Delhi Daredevils
                            where
                            he scored 73* and formed a record-breaking partnership of 203 runs with his teammate
                            Gayle.[346]
                            In their final match of the season, Bangalore faced the Deccan Chargers with the necessity
                            of
                            must-win to qualify for the playoffs. Kohli contributed 42 runs to the team's chase before
                            being
                            dismissed in the 16th over. His dismissal triggered a collapse in Bangalore's batting order,
                            resulting in their eventual defeat and elimination from the tournament during the group
                            stage.[347] During the season, Kohli accumulated a total of 364 runs, garnered over the
                            course
                            of 16 matches. He returned from the League with a sense of disillusionment with his own
                            performance and was dissatisfied with the state of his game. He recognized the need for
                            improvement and adaptation to the evolving dynamics of cricket.</p>
